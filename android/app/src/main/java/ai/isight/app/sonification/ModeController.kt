/**
 * Ticket #25 — the two operating modes. Bible §4: blind users don't walk in one
 * continuous mode — they STOP to orient, then move. The system mirrors that with a
 * deliberate mode split (stated as an HCI decision, not an implementation detail).
 *
 *   FLOW      — walking. Sparse, urgent-only. Center-crop ON (#14), one primary cue,
 *               obstacle/drop-off/head-height hazards only. This is the #14–#24 default.
 *   SCAN_SEEK — stopped, on-demand. Richer, exploratory: "what's around me?" scans the
 *               WHOLE frame (not just center), and this is the home for voice goal-seeking
 *               (Phase 4, #26–#28). Cue density is allowed to rise because the user is
 *               stationary and actively asking, not walking.
