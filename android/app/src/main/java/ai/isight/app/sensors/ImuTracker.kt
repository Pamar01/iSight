/**
 * V3 drop-off plan §1 — time-synchronized gyroscope + accelerometer fusion via a complementary
 * filter, producing pitch/roll for [ai.isight.app.inference.decode.TraversableCorridor]
 * and a high-rotation flag to down-weight vision evidence during fast motion (plan's explicit
 * "reject or down-weight visual updates during very fast rotation" guidance).
 *
 * WHY A COMPLEMENTARY FILTER (not a full Kalman filter, which the plan also mentions as an
 * option): the plan's own wording — "gyro for short-term rotation, gravity from the
 * accelerometer for drift correction" — describes a complementary filter exactly; it's the
 * standard, well-documented approach for this exact sensor pair and is what every public
 * Android sensor-fusion tutorial implements this way. A full Kalman filter would need a proper
 * process/measurement noise model tuned from real device data we don't have yet — not
 * justified over the simpler, well-proven approach for a first version.
 *
 * HONEST LIMITATION: the sign convention below (positive pitch = looking down) is the standard
 * formula for a phone held with its screen facing the user — but this project mounts the phone
 * on the CHEST (see bible §17), which may need a mounting rotation offset.
 * [calibrateMountingOffset] exists for exactly that: call it once while the phone is in its
 * actual mounted position and pointed level, and every subsequent pitch/roll reading is
 * corrected relative to that captured baseline. This has NOT been empirically verified on a
 * real chest-mounted phone yet — treat the sign/axis convention as needing a real on-device
 * check before trusting it blindly for the corridor shift direction.
