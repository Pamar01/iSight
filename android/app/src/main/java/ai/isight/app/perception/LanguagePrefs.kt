 * The user's spoken-language preference, persisted across launches.
 *
 * Drives two things:
 *  - which TTS locale the app speaks its OWN cues in (scene description, sign read-outs,
 *    "person facing you"), English (en-IN / en-US) or Hindi (hi-IN);
 *  - whether a sign whose script does NOT match that preference is run through on-device
 *    translation before being spoken ([translateSigns]) or just read in its native script.
 *
 * The blind user never sees the screen, so the toggles on the debug panel are for the
 * sighted helper during setup; the value sticks so it only has to be set once.
