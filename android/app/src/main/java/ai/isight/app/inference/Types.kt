/**
 * iSight — shared pipeline types.
 *
 * These are the contracts every stage speaks in. They are deliberately defined
 * up front (ticket #6) so that #12 (YOLO loop), #13 (depth loop), #15 (targeting),
 * and Phase 3 (sonification) all plug into the SAME shapes without a rewrite.
 *
 * Invariants baked into the types (from the Bible):
 *  - Depth is RELATIVE proximity, never metres (§5.4). Hence `proximity`, not
 *    `distanceMeters`. Range 0f (far) .. 1f (touching), against the #7 baseline.
 *  - Confidence tiering is first-class (§5.3), not a boolean — see [ConfidenceTier].
 *  - Identity and distance are separate fields because they become separate audio
 *    channels (§5.1); nothing here lets pitch do double duty.
