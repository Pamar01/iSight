/**
 * Thin wrapper around ARCore's availability + install handshake, so the rest of the app can
 * ask "can this device do the room scan?" without touching ARCore APIs directly.
 *
 * Device support is a RUNTIME fact: the iQOO 15 (or any phone) is only AR-capable if Google's
 * per-device calibration has shipped for it AND "Google Play Services for AR" is installed.
 * [availability] answers the first; [ensureInstalled] drives the (one-time, Play-Store) install
 * of the second.
 *
 * Callers: RoomScanActivity (gate + session create), MainActivity (enable/disable the button).
