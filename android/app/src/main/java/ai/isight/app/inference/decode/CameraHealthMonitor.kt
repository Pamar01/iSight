/**
 * Watches for the camera being tampered with, covered, or knocked off its mount — the
 * failure modes that silently wreck every downstream vision signal on a chest-worn rig.
 *
 * Two independent checks, run every frame off the grayscale the pipeline already computes:
 *
 *  1. OCCLUSION / LIGHT — a covered lens reads as a near-textureless frame: very low spatial
 *     std REGARDLESS of brightness (a hand in daylight, a pale shirt, a pocket all pin the
 *     std near zero even when the mean is nowhere near black), OR the classic dark-and-flat
 *     look of a lens covered inside a bag. A merely dim scene (dusk, dim room) is still
 *     low-mean but keeps structure -> [CameraHealth.DIM]. Always active, no setup needed.
 *
 *  2. MOUNT ANGLE — two ways in:
 *     (a) CALIBRATED: after the wearer taps Calibrate while vertical
 *         ([ImuTracker.calibrateMountingOffset] makes pitch/roll read ~0 at that pose), any
 *         sustained tilt beyond [pitchToleranceDeg] / [rollToleranceDeg] from vertical.
 *     (b) UNCALIBRATED: the monitor learns the rig's RESTING pitch/roll as a slow EMA from
 *         frames that already look healthy, then flags a sustained *change* of more than
 *         [autoTiltDeltaDeg] from that rest pose — i.e. "the camera has moved from where it
 *         was". This catches a knocked mount without any setup. The baseline only updates
 *         while the status is OK, so once it's flagged it stays flagged until the rig is put
 *         back. (The old auto-baseline was absolute, not a delta, and locked onto whatever
 *         tilt the phone had at app start — this one tracks the change instead.)
 *
 * Debounced: a bad status must persist [sustainMs] before it's reported, and OK must hold for
 * [clearMs] before recovery — so a stumble, a bend-down, or a hand briefly crossing the lens
 * doesn't trigger it.
 *
 * Grayscale values are 0..255 (see OpticalFlow.toGrayscale). Stateful; [reset] on session
 * restart. The caller wires the result into RawEvidence.sensorBlocked/lowLight (hazard fusion
 * -> SENSOR_BLOCKED, suppressing phantom drop-off) and FrameResult.cameraHealth (UI warns).
