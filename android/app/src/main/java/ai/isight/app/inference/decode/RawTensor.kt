/**
 * A model output tensor, flattened to a FloatArray plus its shape.
 *
 * WHY FLAT + SHAPE (not nested arrays): every runtime — TFLite today, QNN later —
 * can hand back a directly-allocated float buffer. Keeping the shared decode layer
 * (YoloDecoder / DepthSampler) speaking in this one shape means the SAME decode code
 * runs unchanged regardless of who produced the numbers. That's the whole point of
 * the split: the engine is "run the model, give me RawTensors"; the decode layer is
 * "turn RawTensors into Detections". Neither knows about the other's runtime.
 *
 * @param data  row-major flattened values (NHWC / natural tensor order).
 * @param shape the tensor's dimensions, e.g. [1, 8400, 84] or [1, 518, 518].
