/**
 * Ticket #28 — Vector-to-Goal cueing. The single clearest differentiator: *they describe, we
 * vector*. Once a spoken goal is grounded to a box each frame (#27), this turns that box into
 * a continuous steering [CueTarget] — pan toward it (direction), pulse/haptics as you close in
 * (distance) — reusing the exact same cue engine as obstacle avoidance, and signals ARRIVAL
 * when the goal is centered and close.
 *
 * Pure logic over a grounded box, so it's testable off-device and identical on any backend.
 * The only Phase-4-specific dependency (the OWL-ViT grounder) lives upstream; this just steers.
