/**
 * Fills in the COARSE motion signals the pipeline expects — [Detection.moving] (#15's
 * static/dynamic split) and [Detection.approaching] (rate-of-approach, #13) — by matching
 * each detection to the previous frame's detection of the same class.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY COARSE (Bible §11/§13.2): this is a "is this box moving" flag and a signed
 * proximity delta, NOT velocity tracking and NOT Time-to-Collision. Full frame-to-frame
 * TTC physics is a rejected stretch goal. One frame of memory, nearest-center matching
 * within a gate — cheap, and enough to let a walking person outrank a parked chair.
 *
 * Stateful: one instance per engine. Runtime-agnostic — the QNN engine reuses it as-is.

     * lags a fast-moving object more than a slow proximity change). This is deliberately only
