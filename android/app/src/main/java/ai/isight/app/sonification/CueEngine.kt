/**
 * Ticket #22 — Cue Engine Integration. The crown jewel.
 *
 * Runs a CONTINUOUS cue loop on its own thread, independent of the camera frame rate.
 * The vision side just posts the current [CueTarget] (via [update]); this loop decides
 * WHEN the next pulse fires and renders it across all channels AT ONCE, kept orthogonal:
 *
 *   DIRECTION (#18): AudioOutput pan, equal-power law, from target.azimuth.
 *   DISTANCE  (#19): the INTER-PULSE INTERVAL — faster pulses = closer. Pitch untouched.
 *   IDENTITY  (#20): the auditory icon (or spearcon) chosen by target.label — the timbre.
 *   PROXIMITY (#21): HapticOutput graded buzz in parallel — the PRIMARY how-close channel.
 *   TEXTURE   (§5.3): confidence tier shapes graininess/gain, never the above.
 *
 * The single hard rule this class exists to protect: no dimension bleeds into another's
 * channel. Distance changes the RATE, never the pitch. Identity changes the TIMBRE,
 * never the rate. Direction changes the PAN, nothing else.
