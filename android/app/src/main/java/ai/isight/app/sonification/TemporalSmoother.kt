/**
 * Ticket #16 — Temporal smoothing.
 *
 * Raw per-frame detections flicker: a target appears for one frame, a spurious box pops in
 * and out, identity jitters. If every such blip fired a cue, the audio/haptic stream would
 * stutter — the exact instability that made the thrown-object test too high-variance to keep
 * (Bible §19.1). This gate requires a target to PERSIST for [confirmFrames] consecutive
 * frames — same identity, roughly the same azimuth — before its cue is allowed to fire.
 *
 * Brief flickers (a hand waved through frame for a frame or two) never reach the cue engine;
 * a steady target confirms after a beat and then tracks live. Runtime-agnostic: it gates the
 * resolved [CueTarget], so it works identically on the mock, the TFLite engine, and QNN.
 *
 * Stateful — one instance per app session. Reset happens implicitly when the target is lost
 * (a null frame resets the streak so a new target starts fresh).
 */
