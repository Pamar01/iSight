/**
 * Canonical "is it safe / can I move / is the way clear" phrasings, in English, Hindi and
 * Kannada, for the Tier-2 [SafetyVectorGate]. At init the embedding model turns each of these
 * into a vector; at query time the user's transcript is embedded and compared (max cosine
 * similarity) against the whole set. A hit above the tuned threshold classifies the query as
 * SAFETY_CRITICAL and bypasses the generative LLM.
 *
 * Curation rules (from the deep-research test plan):
 *  - Cover the INTENT ("may I proceed?"), not just the words. Vary verbs (cross/walk/go/move),
 *    subjects (I / the path / the road), politeness, and directness.
 *  - Include the ambiguous-but-should-still-deflect cases ("describe the crosswalk",
 *    "are there cars ahead") — a false positive here is a fail-SAFE degradation.
 *  - Do NOT include benign scene questions ("what colour is the door", "read that sign").
 *  - Keep it 40-200 lines; more anchors = smoother decision boundary. Extend freely.
