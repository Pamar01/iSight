/**
 * Ticket #17 — Drop-off / negative-obstacle detection.
 *
 * A white cane finds the ground; the camera's job is to find the ABSENCE of ground — the
 * case the cane's structural blind spot and a plain "object in the way" detector both miss
 * (Bible §8). Curbs, downward stairs, unguarded platform edges and potholes are life-safety
 * critical in Indian streets, and nothing else in the pipeline answers the downward case.
 *
 * V2 — REPLACES the original fixed-band version after live-phone testing on a real staircase
 * showed the fixed-band comparison (hardcoded near/mid-ground zones) simply never fires
 * whenever the framing/geometry doesn't match its assumed camera-close-to-ground setup — it
 * missed a real staircase entirely (validated against a real photo: band diff was -0.09,
 * nowhere near the fire threshold). This version is adaptive instead of fixed-geometry:
 *
 *   1. Scan the lower half of the depth map for the SHARPEST vertical gradient (Sobel-style
 *      central difference) in the center column — wherever it actually is, not a fixed band.
 *   2. Confirm it's a real drop-off and not just any object boundary (a desk edge, a chair
 *      back) by checking the SIGN of the proximity change right around that row: proximity
 *      must read farther just past the edge than just before it — the actual physical
 *      signature of "the ground disappeared here." An object boundary usually reads the
 *      OPPOSITE way (something nearer sits behind it, e.g. floor visible under a desk).
 *      Validated offline: a desk-edge photo showed local_diff=-0.084 (correctly rejected)
 *      while the real staircase showed local_diff=+0.058 (correctly fires).
 *
 * Both checks must pass. This is deliberately still conservative — a flat floor has no sharp
 * gradient at all (step 1 alone rejects it) — but no longer BLIND to hazards outside a
 * hardcoded zone. No fabricated metres (Bible §5.4): [Edge.rowFraction] is frame-relative
 * position only. Runtime-agnostic: consumes a [DepthSampler.Frame] directly (no [DepthSampler]
 * instance needed), so the TFLite engine and the future QNN engine share it unchanged.
