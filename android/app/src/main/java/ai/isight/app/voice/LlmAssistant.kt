/**
 * Phase 4 — the on-device reasoning fallback. When the deterministic [IntentInterpreter] grammar
 * can't place a transcript ([VoiceIntent.Unknown]), it comes here: a small quantized LLM
 * (Llama-3.2-1B INT4 via MediaPipe's LLM Inference API) that either
 *  - maps the free-form request onto the SAME closed action set ([LlmResolution.Action]), or
 *  - answers a question about what the app currently sees ([LlmResolution.Speak]).
 *
 * The model file (~1 GB `.task`) is NEVER bundled — it is side-loaded to the device and the
 * MediaPipe-backed implementation lives in a flag-gated source set (`-PenableLlm=true`, see
 * app/build.gradle.kts), resolved BY NAME here exactly like the sherpa recognizer. With no
 * model / no flag, [LlmAssistants.create] returns [StubLlmAssistant] and callers degrade
 * honestly — the grammar still handles every common command, the LLM just isn't there for the
 * long tail.
 *
 * Caller: MainActivity (construct once, query on the Unknown branch off the main thread).
