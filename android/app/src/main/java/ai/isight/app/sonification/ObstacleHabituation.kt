/**
 * Habituation for the continuous obstacle cue.
 *
 * The problem: standing in front of (or beside) a static object — a wall, a parked chair —
 * the cue engine keeps beeping forever even though nothing is changing and the user has
 * clearly registered it. That's fatiguing and drowns out signals that DO matter.
 *
 * The rule: alert normally for [alertHoldMs] after a situation first appears or changes, then
 * fall SILENT for that same obstacle unless the situation *worsens*:
 *   - the user is closing on it (smoothed approach signal, or proximity climbing above the
 *     level it settled at), or
 *   - the target is a different obstacle / the user has turned toward something else.
 * A genuinely imminent obstacle ([imminentProximity]+, i.e. about to be walked into) is never
 * fully silenced — it drops to a faint slow "still here" pulse instead.
 *
 * Only gates the obstacle-spine [CueTarget]. The voice goal cue, the memory-nav cue, and the
 * edge-triggered drop-off / overhead HAPTICS all bypass this and are unaffected.
 *
 * Stateful — one instance per session; [reset] on mode change / pause.
