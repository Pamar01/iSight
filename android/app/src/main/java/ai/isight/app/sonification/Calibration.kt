/**
 * Ticket #7 — One-tap calibration.
 *
 * Monocular depth is RELATIVE, not metric (Bible §5.4). Calibration is what gives the
 * relative-proximity ordering a meaningful zero: the user holds the phone level looking
 * forward at normal walking clearance and taps once, and we snapshot the current
 * center-of-frame proximity as the BASELINE. From then on, proximity is re-referenced
 * against that baseline — "closer than my calibrated forward clearance" is what drives
 * urgency, which is exactly the claim the pitch makes (a one-tap baseline, not a false
 * metric range, not full gyroscope auto-correction).
 *
 * OFF BY DEFAULT: with no baseline captured, [apply] is an identity passthrough, so the
 * app behaves exactly as before until the user opts in. Tapping again clears it. Thread-safe
 * for the single writer (UI tap) / single reader (frame loop) pattern.
