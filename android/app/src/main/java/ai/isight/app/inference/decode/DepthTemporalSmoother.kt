/**
 * Research-candidate item (isight_research_candidates_v1.md, §2) — temporal EMA
 * smoothing of the raw depth map across consecutive depth-inference runs (NOT every camera
 * frame — depth itself only runs every Nth frame already, see TfliteInferenceEngine's
 * depthEveryN). Validated offline before writing this: ~47% frame-to-frame noise reduction
 * on simulated jitter, with negligible lag on the real underlying signal (alpha=0.3 tracks a
 * real trend within 2-3 depth-runs, not dozens).
 *
 * WHY: raw single-frame monocular depth is noisy pixel-to-pixel even when nothing in the
 * scene changed — sensor noise, lighting flicker, model non-determinism. That noise directly
 * feeds DropOffDetector's gradient search, so smoothing it reduces false-positive drop-off
 * triggers from noise alone, without touching the detection LOGIC itself (still the V2
 * adaptive Sobel + sign-check detector — this only cleans its input before it gets there).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT full Kalman/optical-flow registration (tracking corners frame-to-frame to
 * compensate for camera motion between smoothed frames) — that's a bigger, higher-risk build,
 * explicitly flagged as a "future session" item in the research doc. Plain EMA is the cheap,
 * validated first cut: correct when the camera is roughly still or panning slowly (normal
 * walking pace), imperfect during a fast whip-pan — an acceptable tradeoff for now.
 *
 * Runtime-agnostic (no Android dependency), like the rest of decode/ — TFLite and the future
 * QNN engine share this unchanged.
