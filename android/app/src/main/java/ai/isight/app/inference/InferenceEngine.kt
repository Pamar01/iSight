/**
 * The one seam that keeps iSight laptop-buildable before the phone/NPU exist.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Ticket #6 has to be built and tested with NO converted model binaries in hand
 * (those come from convert.py on Qualcomm's cloud, tickets #8–#11). So the camera
 * loop, the output channels, and the UI all talk to THIS interface, and we ship a
 * [MockInferenceEngine] now. When the first QNN context binary lands, a
 * `QnnInferenceEngine : InferenceEngine` drops in behind the same interface and
 * NOTHING upstream changes.
 *
 * INVARIANT (Bible, build-map #6): the laptop is never a compute dependency. Both
 * implementations run entirely on-device. The mock computes locally too — it just
 * fabricates detections instead of reading the NPU.
