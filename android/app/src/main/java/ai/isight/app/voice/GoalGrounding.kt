/**
 * Phase 4 — the GROUNDING half, non-QNN path (stand-in for #27 / OWL-ViT).
 *
 * OWL-ViT open-vocabulary grounding has no working TFLite export and the Hexagon NPU is
 * access-gated on this device, so "where is the <thing> I asked for" is answered instead by
 * matching the spoken noun against the object classes the already-running yolo26s detector
 * emits every frame. `Detection.label` is already collapsed to the icon vocab by
 * CocoLabels.toIconVocab, so the match is against that vocab plus raw COCO names.
 *
 * SCOPE, stated honestly: CLOSED-vocabulary — only the ~80 COCO classes (collapsed to
 * person / chair / vehicle / furniture / dog / raw-name). "find the chair" works; "find the
 * door" (door is not a COCO class) grounds nothing. [SYNONYMS] bridges everyday words the user
 * actually says ("bag", "sofa", "phone", "tv") onto the labels the detector emits.
