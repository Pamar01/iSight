/**
 * Ticket #24 — Graceful-Degradation Ladder. Formalizes §5.3 / §13.3.
 *
 * #23 gave us WHITE/BLUE/RED as a signal-quality judgement. #24 turns that (plus
 * proximity and depth availability) into an explicit, TOTAL rung decision for the cue
 * engine — "total" meaning every possible input lands on exactly one defined rung, so
 * there is never a dead end and never silence-by-omission.
 *
 * The three rungs (Bible §13.3):
 *   FULL     — identity (icon) + direction (pan) + distance (pulse rate). WHITE tier.
 *   PROXIMITY— drop identity, keep proximity-pulse + uncertainty texture. BLUE/RED tier.
 *   PANIC    — haptic-only threshold when something is very close (< the panic proximity),
 *              regardless of what audio can say. This is the floor: it can fire UNDER any
 *              audio state, including when there's no usable audio cue at all.
 *
 * KEY DESIGN POINT — PANIC is not "the bottom of a chain you fall through"; it's an
 * always-checked FLOOR. A close object at RED tier is both PROXIMITY (for audio: bare
 * pulse) AND PANIC (for haptics: hard buzz). The ladder therefore returns the audio rung
 * separately from a panic flag, so the two never cancel each other. That's what "no dead
 * end — each rung degrades to the next automatically" means in practice: the system can
 * always still buzz you away from a wall even when it has nothing intelligent to say.
