/**
 * Research-candidate item (isight_research_candidates_v1.md, §7) — cross-checks a
 * vision-only drop-off detection against the phone's barometer, entirely independent of the
 * camera/depth model. This targets a REAL, CONFIRMED bug: Depth-Anything-V2 produced an
 * inverted/wrong-sign gradient on a genuine descending staircase photo this session
 * (stairs2.jpeg, validated via debug_dropoff_v2.py) — a barometer can't be fooled by texture
 * or lighting the way a monocular depth model can, so it's a genuinely independent signal.
 *
 * PHYSICS: near sea level, atmospheric pressure increases by roughly 0.12 hPa per 1 metre of
 * descent (the standard barometric approximation, dP/dh ≈ -0.12 hPa/m at sea-level conditions
 * — this is an approximation, not exact at all altitudes/temperatures, but good enough for
 * "is the user's altitude dropping over the last few seconds," which is all we need).
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT in the decode/ layer: DropOffDetector is runtime-agnostic (TFLite/QNN
 * share it, no Android dependency by design). This class is an app-layer ENRICHMENT that
 * MainActivity consults alongside the vision result — it never replaces the vision-based
 * detect(), only confirms or informs it, keeping the pure-algorithm layer untouched.
 *
 * Most phones expose Sensor.TYPE_PRESSURE; if absent (some budget devices lack a barometer),
 * [isAvailable] is false and every check degrades to "unknown" rather than crashing.
