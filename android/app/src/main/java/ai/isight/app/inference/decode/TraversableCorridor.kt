/**
 * V3 drop-off plan §2 — the IMU-stabilized traversable corridor: a normalized-coordinate
 * region of the frame representing "where the user could step next," shifted using the
 * phone's estimated pitch/roll (see [ImuTracker]) instead of a fixed lower-half band (V1's
 * known failure mode — see DropOffDetector's history).
 *
 * SIMPLIFICATION FROM THE PLAN: the plan describes a full trapezoid rotated by pitch AND roll.
 * This is an axis-aligned rectangle instead — GroundPlaneAnalyzer/EdgeLattice/DropOffDetector
 * all already operate on axis-aligned row/column ranges (no per-pixel rotation), so a rotated
 * trapezoid would need a much larger rewrite of every consumer for a benefit that's mostly
 * relevant at extreme roll angles, which [ImuTracker] already down-weights evidence during
 * (see HIGH_ROTATION handling). Pitch shifts the corridor vertically (looking down moves the
 * floor higher in-frame, so the corridor should start higher up); roll widens the corridor
 * slightly to cover the uncertainty a rotated rect can't otherwise represent.
 *
 * This is a WEIGHTING region as the plan specifies, not a hard crop in principle — but the
 * current consumers (EdgeLattice, GroundPlaneAnalyzer) treat it as a search bound rather than a
 * soft-decay mask, since per-pixel weighting would need reworking their row/column loops for a
 * marginal accuracy gain not yet justified by validation data.
