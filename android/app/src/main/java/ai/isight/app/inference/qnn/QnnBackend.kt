/**
 * The seam between the QNN runtime (Qualcomm AI Engine Direct — the Hexagon NPU / HTP) and
 * iSight's runtime-agnostic decode layer.
 *
 * WHY A SEAM: the compiled models on the phone are `qnn_context_binary` (.bin) files that run
 * through a native C++ runtime regardless of app framework. A real implementation of this
 * interface is a thin JNI bridge (src/main/cpp + the externalNativeBuild block in
 * build.gradle, currently stubbed off) that loads a context binary and executes it on the
 * HTP, returning flat float tensors. Everything DOWNSTREAM of this — [ai.isight.app
 * .inference.decode] — is shared with the TFLite path unchanged, which is the whole point:
 * when the iQOO 15 + QNN SDK are in hand, only this bridge is filled in; the decode + fusion
 * + sonification stack does not change.
 *
 * Until that native bridge exists, [StubQnnBackend] reports notReady, so [ai.isight.app
 * .inference.EngineConfig] falls back to the TFLite engine (or the mock) and the app never
 * hard-crashes on a missing runtime.
