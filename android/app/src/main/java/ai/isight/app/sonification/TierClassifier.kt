/**
 * Ticket #23 — the self-trust / uncertainty layer.
 *
 * Turns raw detector signal into a WHITE/BLUE/RED confidence tier (Bible §5.3). This
 * is deliberately SEPARATE from where the mock happens to set a tier: the mock scripts
 * tiers for demo variety, but the REAL system must DERIVE the tier from the actual
 * signal — detection score + whether depth is present — so it behaves identically when
 * QnnInferenceEngine replaces the mock. That's what this class does.
 *
 * The tiers, and the honest claim each makes (§5.3):
 *   WHITE — "I see it and I know what it is."   score high, depth present.
 *   BLUE  — "Something's there, I'm not sure what." score low-but-real, depth present.
 *   RED   — "Something's there, I can't name it."   no reliable class, depth only.
 *
 * The system SOUNDS unsure on BLUE and ADMITS it doesn't know on RED — it never goes
 * silent and never fakes crisp confidence. "The device knows when it doesn't know" is
 * the defensible stage claim; this class is where that claim is actually true.
 *
 * HYSTERESIS: raw per-frame scores jitter around the thresholds, which would make the
 * audio texture stutter between clean and grainy every few frames — audibly worse than
 * either. So promotions (toward WHITE) require clearing a slightly HIGHER bar than
 * demotions, and a tier must persist a couple of frames before it's allowed to change.
 * This mirrors the temporal-smoothing intent of #16, applied to the tier itself.
