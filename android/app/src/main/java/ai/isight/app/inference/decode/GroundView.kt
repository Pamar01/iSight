/**
 * Object-mask suppression — the fix for the real on-device false positive (desk + laptop +
 * keyboard scene, both [EdgeLattice] and [GroundPlaneAnalyzer] fired on their own narrow
 * definitions). Uses the YOLO detections the engine already computes every frame — no new
 * model, no new data — to check whether a "drop-off" candidate is actually sitting on/behind a
 * desk-like object rather than open floor.
 *
 * SUPPRESSION VOCAB: [CocoLabels.toIconVocab] buckets dining table/tv/laptop/refrigerator/
 * oven/microwave into "furniture" and chair/couch/bench/bed/toilet into "chair"; keyboard and
 * mouse pass through unbucketed. All five of those icon-vocab labels are desk/seating-like
 * objects that commonly dominate a near-field view without being a walkable floor.
