/**
 * V3 drop-off plan §4 — classical RGB edge lattice, no training data. Finds several roughly
 * parallel, roughly-horizontal, evenly-spaced lines inside a corridor (candidate stair
 * nosings), and scores how convincingly they form a real periodic lattice vs. random
 * scene clutter (shelf edges, table lines, floor seams).
 *
 * VALIDATED OFFLINE (debug_v3_fusion.py) against the same 4 photos GroundPlaneAnalyzer used —
 * this is the SECOND algorithm tried: a naive per-row gradient-energy version was tried FIRST
 * and demonstrably failed (missed the real target case, stairs2.jpeg, entirely — see the
 * script's git history/comments). This angle-restricted Hough-line version is what actually
 * passed: correctly SAFE on bottle.jpeg (flat floor) and stairs1.jpeg (ascending stairs, the
 * plan's explicit hard-negative), while finding real lattice structure on both stairs.jpg and
 * stairs2.jpeg (the hard descending case with a wrong-signed depth read).
 *
 * WHY NOT OpenCV: this project has zero CV-library dependency by design (GroundPlaneAnalyzer,
 * DropOffDetector, OpticalFlow are all hand-rolled pure-Kotlin/array math) — adding the OpenCV
 * Android SDK for one feature would be a large new native dependency for a narrow angle-range
 * line search that's genuinely cheap to hand-roll instead.
 *
 * DEPENDENCY-FREE DESIGN: since only near-horizontal lines matter here (a stair nosing is
 * never steeply diagonal after rough camera leveling), this restricts the Hough angle search to
 * a narrow band instead of the usual full 180° sweep — far cheaper than general-purpose Hough,
 * parameterized by (angle bin, row-intercept-at-corridor-center bin) rather than the usual
 * (rho, theta) polar form, which is a simpler accumulator for this narrow use case.
