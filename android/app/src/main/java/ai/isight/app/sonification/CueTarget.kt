/**
 * The single resolved target the [CueEngine] sonifies at any moment.
 *
 * This is the clean handoff between the VISION half (targeting, #15) and the AUDIO
 * half (sonification, #18–#22). Targeting decides WHICH one thing to cue; the cue
 * engine decides HOW it sounds/feels. Keeping this as a tiny value type is what lets
 * each channel be tested in isolation against synthetic CueTargets (the build map's
 * "build each channel standalone against synthetic inputs first").
 *
 * The three orthogonal dimensions (Bible §5.1) map to three fields — and nothing here
 * lets one field drive two channels:
 *   azimuth   -> DIRECTION (pan, #18)
 *   proximity -> DISTANCE  (pulse repetition rate, #19) + haptic intensity (#21)
 *   label     -> IDENTITY  (auditory icon / spearcon, #20)
 * tier shapes TEXTURE only (§5.3), never identity or distance.
