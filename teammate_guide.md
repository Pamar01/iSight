# iSight — Explained For Someone Who Knows Nothing
### A complete guide with zero jargon and real examples

---

## START HERE: What Is This App?

Imagine you are blind. You have a white cane. You tap it on the ground as you walk.

The cane tells you: **"Floor here. Floor here. Floor here. WALL."**

But the cane has one massive blind spot — it only sweeps the ground.
It cannot tell you about:
- A cabinet door that is open at your face height
- A staircase that suddenly drops
- A person walking toward you
- Where the exit door is

**iSight is the phone app that fills that blind spot.**

You clip the phone to your chest (camera facing forward). The app watches the world
constantly and tells you what it sees — through **sound in your ear** and **buzzes on your phone**.
You never touch the screen. You never look at the screen.

The most important thing: **it works with zero internet.** Airplane mode. No Wi-Fi.
No servers. Everything happens inside the phone's chip. So if you're on a train platform
in rural India with no signal, it still works.

```

Let's walk through each step like a story.

---

## STEP 1: THE CAMERA — The App's Eyes

The phone camera takes 30 pictures every second. Not photos you see — they go straight
into the app. Each picture is a grid of tiny colored squares called **pixels**.

Think of it like this:

```
A very zoomed-in picture of a chair:

🟫🟫🟫🟫🟤🟤🟤🟤🟫🟫
🟫🟫🟤🟤⬛⬛⬛⬛🟤🟤
🟫🟤🟤⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛🟤
🟤🟤⬛⬛🟫🟫🟫⬛⬛⬛
...
```

Each tiny square has a color. The camera gives the app millions of these squares, 30 times
per second. On its own, the app has no idea what any of this means — it's just colors.

That's where the AI models come in.

---

## STEP 2: THE AI MODELS — The App's Brain

### What is an AI model?

Think of it like this:

A human child learns what a dog is by seeing thousands of dogs. You show them:
- A big fluffy dog → "dog"
- A small brown dog → "dog"
- A running dog → "dog"

After seeing thousands of examples, the child just **knows** what a dog looks like.
They don't read rules. They just recognize it.

An AI model is the same thing, but for a computer. We showed it millions of pictures
of chairs, people, cars, dogs — each labeled with what it is. The computer learned
the patterns. Now it can look at a new picture it's never seen and say "that's a person."

**iSight has 3 AI brains running at the same time:**

---

### AI BRAIN 1: YOLOv11 — "The Guard Who Spots Objects"

**Job: Look at the camera picture. Draw a box around every object. Name it.**

Imagine a very fast security guard at the entrance of a building. Every person who
walks in, he immediately spots, draws an imaginary box around them, and shouts:
"Person! Front and center! 90% sure!"

That's exactly what YOLOv11 does, 30 times a second.

**What it tells us:**

```
Example: camera sees a corridor with a chair and a person

Output:
  Box 1: [Chair] — it's in the right side of the frame — 85% confident
  Box 2: [Person] — it's in the center of the frame — 93% confident
```

**Real example in your project:**

You're walking down a hospital corridor. The camera sees:
- A wheelchair (it recognizes it as "chair" — close enough)
- A nurse walking toward you

YOLOv11 draws boxes around both and says:
- "Chair on the right, 82% sure"
- "Person in the center, 91% sure"

But at this point the app doesn't know HOW FAR they are. That's the next model's job.

---

### AI BRAIN 2: Depth-Anything-V2 — "The Distance Guesser"

**Job: Look at the same picture. Create a map of how close everything is.**

A normal photo is flat — it has no depth information. A big building far away and a
small box right in front of you can look the same size in a photo.

But humans know intuitively: "that looks far," "that looks close." We use cues like:
- Things that look bigger are usually closer
- Blurry backgrounds are usually far
- Things that look dimmer are usually far

This model learned those same tricks by studying millions of photos where people
measured the actual distances. Now it can guess distances from a flat photo.

**What it produces: A "depth map"**

Imagine taking the camera picture and recoloring every pixel:
- Bright white = very close (right in front of you)
- Dark grey = medium distance
- Black = very far

```
Real camera picture:           Depth map:
┌─────────────────────┐        ┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │        │                     │
│  [person]  [chair]  │   →   │  [WHITE]    [GREY]  │
│                     │        │                     │
│   [floor stretches] │        │   [BLACK → WHITE]   │
└─────────────────────┘        └─────────────────────┘
```

Person is close → WHITE (bright)
Chair is medium distance → GREY
Far wall → BLACK

**Important honesty:** This model CANNOT tell you "the person is 2.3 metres away."
It can only say "the person is CLOSER than the chair." Relative, not exact.
The app is honest about this and never pretends otherwise.

---

### AI BRAIN 3: YamNet — "The Ear"

**Job: Listen to the microphone. Identify sounds.**

This brain runs separately from the camera. It listens to the microphone constantly
and recognizes 521 types of sounds — car horn, siren, alarm, dog bark, speech, explosion.

**Why do we need this?**

The camera only sees what's in FRONT of you. A car horn behind you, a siren from the
left — those are invisible to the camera. But the microphone hears them.

**Real example:**

You're crossing a road. The camera is looking forward at the pavement.
A car behind you honks.
YamNet hears it → phone gives 4 rapid buzzes on your hand → "SOUND HAZARD"

You step back without even turning around.

**Second use — it detects when you're talking:**

If YamNet hears human speech (someone talking to you), the app quietly reduces its
own audio volume by up to 50% so you can hear the conversation.
But if a car is about to hit you, it ignores the conversation and still buzzes you full force.

---

## STEP 3: THE BRAIN LOGIC — Making Sense of Everything

Now the app has:
- A list of objects and where they are (from YOLOv11)
- How close each object is (from Depth-Anything-V2)
- What sounds are happening (from YamNet)

But it still needs to decide: **What should I tell the person right now?**

This is where the "brain logic" runs. Let's break it into pieces.

---

### RULE 1: Only Focus on What's Directly Ahead

When you're walking, you only need to know about things that are in your path.
Things to your far left or far right — you'll walk around them naturally.

So the app only pays attention to objects in the **center 30% of the frame**.

```
Camera frame:

|←——————30%——————→|
LEFT   [CENTER ZONE]   RIGHT
ignore  ← only this  ignore
         matters when
         walking
```

**Real example:**

You're walking down a street. There's a person on the footpath to your right (not in
your path) and a bike in the center (directly in your path).

App ignores the person, warns you about the bike. Makes sense.

---

### RULE 2: The Closest One Wins

If two things are in your path, the app warns about the closer one first.

A wall 0.5 metres away is more urgent than a chair 2 metres away.

---

### RULE 3: Moving Beats Still

If a person is walking TOWARD you and a chair is sitting still, both at similar distances —
the PERSON gets the warning, not the chair.

A chair you can walk around at leisure. A person walking toward you cannot wait.

---

### RULE 4: How Honest Is the Detection? (WHITE / BLUE / RED)

This is one of the most important ideas in the whole app.

Imagine a doctor. Three types of doctors:

```
DR. WHITE — confident
"You have a broken ankle. I can see it clearly on the X-ray."
(Full information. Very sure.)

DR. BLUE — unsure
"Something is wrong with your ankle, but the X-ray is a bit blurry.
Could be a fracture. Be careful."
(Information present. Not completely sure.)

DR. RED — honest
"Something is there in your scan. I can't name it right now.
You're in some kind of trouble. Be cautious."
(No diagnosis, but won't pretend everything's fine.)
```

Your app works the same way:

```
WHITE: "Person detected, 91% confident. 1 metre ahead, slightly right."
  → Clean, crisp sound. Full information.

BLUE:  "Something detected, 48% confident. 1 metre ahead, slightly right."
  → Same sound but with a slight 'grainy' texture. Audibly sounds less sure.

RED:   "Something is close. I cannot identify it."
  → Just a neutral tick sound. No identity claim. But still warns you.
```

**The critical design rule:** The app NEVER goes silent just because it's unsure.
It NEVER pretends to be confident when it isn't. The sound itself tells you how sure the app is.

---

## STEP 4: THE OUTPUT — What You Actually Feel and Hear

The app communicates through 3 completely separate channels. Each channel carries ONE piece of information and never mixes with the others.

---

### CHANNEL 1: Stereo Sound → DIRECTION (Where Is It?)

Your ears work in stereo. Sound from the left comes more to your left ear.
Sound from the right comes more to your right ear.

The app does exactly this:

```
Object on your LEFT → sound mostly in LEFT ear
Object in CENTER   → sound equally in BOTH ears
Object on your RIGHT → sound mostly in RIGHT ear
```

**Real example:**

You're walking. A person is slightly to your left.
You hear the "footstep" sound slightly louder in your left ear.
You naturally drift right to avoid them. No thinking needed.

---

### CHANNEL 2: Pulse Speed → DISTANCE (How Close Is It?)

Think of the reversing beep on a truck backing up:

```
BEEP............BEEP............BEEP  ← truck far away (slow beeps)
BEEP......BEEP......BEEP             ← truck getting closer
BEEP..BEEP..BEEP..BEEP              ← truck very close
BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP                     ← ABOUT TO HIT SOMETHING
```

Your app works identically:

```
Object far away → beep every 900 milliseconds (very slow, relaxed)
Object medium   → beep every 500 milliseconds
Object close    → beep every 200 milliseconds (faster, alert)
Object very close → beep every 120 milliseconds (urgent!)
```

Everyone in India already knows what faster beeping means — trucks, parking sensors,
ATMs. No training needed. It's culturally pre-learned.

---

### CHANNEL 3: Sound Type → IDENTITY (What Is It?)

Instead of saying "beep" for everything, the app uses sounds that resemble the actual object:

```
Person detected   → a soft "thud" sound (like a footstep)
Dog detected      → a quick rising "yip" sound
Car/vehicle       → a low rumbling sound (like an engine)
Chair/furniture   → a dry wooden "knock" sound
Door detected     → a two-part "clack" sound (latch + panel)
Unknown object    → a neutral soft "tick"
```

**Why not just say "PERSON" out loud?** 

Because speech takes time. "Person" = 0.4 seconds. By the time it finishes saying
"person," you might have already walked into them. A short recognizable sound takes
only 0.1 seconds. Much faster reaction.

(For unusual objects the app CAN'T make a sound for — like a "fire hydrant" or "toothbrush" —
it falls back to a sped-up voice saying the word very quickly, like "hydrant!" in 0.2 seconds.)

---

### HAPTIC CHANNEL: The Buzzes → ALWAYS PRESENT

The buzz of the phone is the most important channel. It always works, even if:
- Your earphones fall out
- There's too much noise to hear
- You're on a call

```
Object far:     gentle buzz, low amplitude
Object medium:  medium buzz
Object close:   strong buzz, harder vibration
DANGER ZONE:    double-hit BUZZ BUZZ (like a bouncer grabbing your arm)
Drop-off ahead: three escalating BUZZ → BUZZ → BUZZ (getting stronger)
Hazard sound:   four rapid taps (like someone tapping your wrist)
```

The person using the app doesn't have to hear anything to know a wall is 30cm away.
The phone tells their hand.

---

## THE DROP-OFF DETECTOR — "The Floor Is Disappearing"

This is the part of the app that handles the most dangerous situation:
**when the floor suddenly drops away** — stairs going down, a platform edge, a pothole,
a curb.

The white cane actually catches ground-level drops. But here's the Indian street reality:
potholes happen suddenly, train platform edges are unguarded, construction sites have
unmarked drops.

**How the app detects it:**

Look at what the depth map looks like at a drop-off:

```
Camera sees this corridor with a sudden stair down:

Top of frame (far away):     ←  depth = dark/far
Middle of frame:             ←  depth = grey/medium
Just before the stair edge:  ←  depth = bright/close (floor is near)
RIGHT AT THE EDGE:           ←  SUDDEN CHANGE  ← the app finds this
Below the edge:              ←  depth = dark/far (void below)
```

The app scans the lower part of the depth map looking for exactly this pattern:
"something was close, then suddenly it's far." That's a drop.

When found, it checks: "is this actually a drop-off, or just a chair leg?"

A chair leg would be: "something was far, then suddenly it's close" (the opposite sign).
A drop-off: "something was close, then suddenly it's far" (floor disappears).

If confirmed → three escalating buzzes on your hand (weak → medium → strong).
You stop. You don't step off the platform.

---

## THE WALKING SCENARIO — Full Story

Let me walk through exactly what happens in one real situation.

**You are a blind person. App is running. You are walking through a hospital corridor toward the exit.**

```
SECOND 0: Walking forward, corridor is clear

  Camera sees: empty corridor
  YOLOv11: "No objects"
  Depth: "Nothing close in center"
  App: silent. No buzzes. Walk freely.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECOND 2: A nurse walks into your path from the left side

  Camera sees: person in center-left of frame
  YOLOv11: "Person. 87% confident. Center-left."
  Depth: "Person is 2.5 metres away" (relatively far, medium grey)
  Tier check: 87% = WHITE tier (confident)
  
  What you experience:
  - Left ear: soft "thud" sound (footstep = person)
  - Pulse: every 500ms (medium distance)
  - Buzz: gentle, medium strength

  You register: "Person ahead-left, medium distance."

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECOND 4: The nurse keeps walking toward you. Now 1 metre away.

  Depth: "Person is now 1 metre away" (much brighter in depth map)
  
  What you experience:
  - Left ear: louder "thud" sound
  - Pulse: NOW every 200ms (faster! getting closer!)
  - Buzz: stronger vibration

  You register: "Person getting CLOSER fast. Drift right."
  You step slightly to the right.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECOND 5: The nurse passes to your left side safely.

  YOLOv11: "Person no longer in center zone"
  App: goes quiet. Back to normal walking.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECOND 8: You approach a doorway. There's a chair someone left in the corridor.

  Camera sees: chair directly in center
  YOLOv11: "Chair. 79% confident. Dead center."
  Depth: "Chair is 1.5 metres away"

  What you experience:
  - Both ears equally: dry wooden "knock" sound (chair sound)
  - Pulse: every 350ms (moderate)
  - Buzz: medium strength

  You think: "Chair directly ahead. Step around it."

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECOND 12: You're near the exit. You say: "Find the door"

  Microphone hears: "find the door"
  App understands: "door"
  Camera looks for a door shape in the frame
  Finds door: slightly to the right
  
  What you experience:
  - Right ear: "clack" sound (door sound), slightly right
  - Pulses guide you: as you turn right and walk, the sound centers
  - When you're aligned perfectly and close: arrival sound
  
  You found the exit without seeing it.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECOND 18: You reach the exit. Suddenly — a step DOWN.

  Depth map: "The floor was bright (close). Now suddenly dark (far)."
  DropOffDetector: "This is a DROP-OFF. Edge is at 70% down the frame."
  Barometer: "Pressure also changing slightly. Confirmed."
  
  What you experience:
  - Three escalating buzzes: buzz → BUZZ → BUZZ
  - No audio (haptic is the primary warning for drop-offs)

  You stop. You reach down with your cane. Yep — there's a step.
  You step down carefully.
```

---

## WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THINGS GO WRONG?

The app is designed to NEVER be dangerously wrong. There are three levels of failure:

```
LEVEL 1 — Everything is working perfectly:
  App sees you, knows what it is, knows how far.
  → Full sound: identity + direction + distance. Clean crisp audio.

LEVEL 2 — App sees something but isn't sure what it is:
  (e.g., bad lighting, object partially hidden)
  → Same sounds BUT with a "grainy" rough texture. Sounds like a bad radio.
  → You know: "something's there, the app isn't sure what."
  → You slow down.

LEVEL 3 — App can't even classify it, just knows something is there:
  → Bare neutral tick sound + rough texture. No identity claim.
  → You know: "the app admits it's confused. Be careful."

PANIC FLOOR (always active, regardless of level):
  If ANYTHING is within 30cm of you →
  Phone does double-hit BUZZ BUZZ regardless of everything else.
  Even if the app is completely confused about what the object is.
  You WILL be buzzed away from the wall.
```

The design rule: **The app would rather say "I don't know" than say the wrong thing.**
A doctor who guesses wrong is more dangerous than one who says "I need more tests."

## THE LAPTOP DASHBOARD — For Your Teammate Watching

When the demo is happening, you want to show the judges what the app is seeing.

The phone creates a tiny website — just on the local WiFi network (no internet).
Open any browser on a laptop and go to the phone's IP address.

```

Judges can also scan a QR code on the demo table and see this on their own phone.
Everyone in the room can watch what the blind person's app is "seeing" in real time.

## THE PHONE'S SPECIAL CHIP — Why It's Fast

Inside every modern phone there are multiple chips:

```
Normal apps use the CPU (the main brain) for everything.

Your app uses a SPECIAL chip called the NPU (Neural Processing Unit).
The NPU was designed specifically to run AI models.

It's like the difference between:
  - Asking a general surgeon to do brain surgery (CPU running AI) → slow, inefficient
  - Asking a neurosurgeon (NPU) → specialist, much faster, uses less power
```

The iQOO phone has a particularly powerful NPU called the "Hexagon."
This is why YOLO runs in 20 milliseconds (that's 0.02 seconds — faster than an eye blink).
On a normal phone CPU it would take 10× longer and drain the battery.

---

## QUANTIZATION — Making Models Tiny and Fast

AI models are massive. YOLOv11 trained at full quality is 100MB+ and slow.

**Quantization** is like making a high-res photo smaller:

```
FULL QUALITY (like a RAW photo):
  Every number stored with full precision.
  100MB, slow, needs lots of power.
  
QUANTIZED (like a compressed JPEG):
  Every number simplified (rounded to fewer options).
  25MB, 4× faster, uses much less power.
  Quality difference? Almost none for practical use.
```

Your depth model (Depth-Anything-V2) uses an even more aggressive compression:
numbers that normally need 32 options are stored with only 4 options.
The depth map looks almost identical, but it runs in 5 milliseconds.
